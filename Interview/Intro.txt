“Hi, I’m Karengula Dinakar. I work as a full-stack developer and have experience in building applications using Java, Spring Boot, React, PostgreSQL, and microservices.
Right now, I’m working at   (CGG), where I design REST APIs, add JWT authentication, use Redis  , and break down monolithic apps into microservices to make them faster and easier to deploy.
I enjoy working on the full cycle of development—from database design to frontend UI. I also built a Dynamic Ticketing System that can be reused in different projects.
Outside of work, I practice data structures and algorithms and have solved more than 200 problems on LeetCode and GeeksforGeeks.”

⚡ Explaining Projects
1. Work Log Tracker
“This is a task and time tracking platform I built using React.js and Spring Boot.
Team leads can assign tasks, while developers log work updates daily.
I implemented pagination, searching, and sorting for better performance.
Security-wise, I added JWT authentication with role-based APIs for admin vs. normal users.

This improved productivity tracking and gave transparency within the team.”
If they ask impact:
👉 “It helped in clear visibility of workloads and improved accountability in daily work logs.”

2. Dynamic Ticketing System

“This was a reusable ticketing module developed with Spring Boot, Hibernate, PostgreSQL.
It lets users raise and track issues across multiple projects, making it plug-and-play for new applications.
I added email + in-app notifications so users stay updated throughout the ticket lifecycle.
It’s now used in multiple   projects, saving development time and ensuring consistency.”

If they ask impact:
👉 “It increased customer satisfaction by over 60% because issues were resolved faster and in a more structured way.”
