 
Q2: Can you explain your Work Log Tracker project?

I: Tell me about your Work Log Tracker project.

D:
“This was a task management and time tracking platform I built using React.js and Spring Boot. The idea was to let team leads assign tasks, and developers log daily updates.

I implemented pagination, searching, and sorting to optimize performance for large datasets.

I also created role-based APIs with JWT authentication so admins and developers had different permissions.

The result was better transparency and productivity tracking within the team, making daily reporting smooth.”

Q3: Can you explain your Dynamic Ticketing System?

I: What about your Dynamic Ticketing System project?

D:
“This is one of my favorite projects — a reusable ticketing module built in Spring Boot and PostgreSQL.

It allows users to raise, track, and resolve issues across projects.

I made it plug-and-play so it could be integrated with different applications.

I added email + in-app notifications to keep stakeholders informed throughout the ticket lifecycle.

This project was integrated into multiple CGG applications and improved customer satisfaction by over 60% because of faster issue resolution.”

Q4: What’s a technical challenge you solved recently?

I: Can you give me an example of a challenge you faced?

D:
“Yes — in one project, we were hitting performance issues because certain APIs were frequently fetching the same data from the database.

I introduced Redis caching for those endpoints, which reduced DB hits and improved response speed by almost 50%.

This not only improved user experience but also reduced infrastructure load.”

Q5: Why should we hire you?

I: Finally, why should we consider you?

D:
“I bring full-stack expertise, hands-on experience in scaling backend systems with Spring Boot and microservices, and a track record of optimizing performance with caching, security, and clean design patterns.

I’m not just comfortable with coding and problem-solving, but also with delivering production-ready features end-to-end. Given my experience and enthusiasm for learning, I believe I can contribute effectively and grow along with the team.”
