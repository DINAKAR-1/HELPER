🔟 Top Interview-Favorite Microservices Patterns
1. API Gateway Pattern ✅
🗣 Why it’s asked: Most systems use it.

🧠 Interview focus: Aggregation, routing, auth, rate limiting.

💡 Mention tools: Spring Cloud Gateway, Zuul, Kong, NGINX.

2. Service Discovery Pattern 🔍
🔗 Dynamic service registration & lookup.

🧠 Interview focus: How services locate each other without hardcoding.

💡 Mention Eureka, Consul, Kubernetes DNS.

3. Circuit Breaker Pattern 💥
🛡 Protects system from cascading failures.

🧠 Interview focus: States (Closed/Open/Half-open), fallback logic.

💡 Tool: Resilience4j, Hystrix.

4. Retry + Timeout Pattern 🕒
🔄 Retry failed calls smartly, with limits.

⌛ Set timeout for responsiveness.

🧠 Interview focus: Backoff strategies, avoiding Retry Storms.

5. Bulkhead Pattern 🚢
🚪 Isolates resources to limit failure impact.

🧠 Think: one service failing shouldn't sink others.

6. Saga Pattern 🔁 (Distributed Transactions)
🧠 Must-know for handling transactions across services.

💡 Types: Choreography (event-based), Orchestration (central coordinator).

🎯 Key for fintech, e-commerce systems.

7. Event-Driven Architecture 📬
🧠 Loosely coupled systems via events.

💡 Tools: Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS.

👀 Be ready to explain how services react to events asynchronously.

8. CQRS Pattern ✍️🔍
⚖️ Separate reads and writes.

🧠 Great for scaling and complex domains.

💡 Often paired with Event Sourcing.

9. Centralized Configuration Pattern 🛠
📦 Externalize configs to avoid redeploying.

🧠 Talk about Spring Cloud Config, Vault, K8s ConfigMaps.

10. Distributed Tracing / Logging 🧵
🕵️‍♂️ Track requests across services.

💡 Tools: Zipkin, Jaeger, OpenTelemetry.

🧠 Be ready to explain correlation IDs and log aggregation.
