🔟 Top Interview-Favorite Microservices Patterns
------------------------------------------------------------
1. API Gateway Pattern ✅
🗣 Why it’s asked: Most systems use it.
-> Interview focus: Aggregation, routing, auth, rate limiting.
💡 Mention tools: Spring Cloud Gateway, Zuul, Kong, NGINX.
------------------------------------------------------------
2. Service Discovery Pattern 🔍
🔗 Dynamic service registration & lookup.
-> Interview focus: How services locate each other without hardcoding.
💡 Mention Eureka, Consul, Kubernetes DNS.
------------------------------------------------------------
3. Circuit Breaker Pattern 💥
🛡 Protects system from cascading failures.
-> Interview focus: States (Closed/Open/Half-open), fallback logic.
💡 Tool: Resilience4j, Hystrix.
------------------------------------------------------------
4. Retry + Timeout Pattern 🕒
🔄 Retry failed calls smartly, with limits.
⌛ Set timeout for responsiveness.
-> Interview focus: Backoff strategies, avoiding Retry Storms.
------------------------------------------------------------
5. Bulkhead Pattern 🚢
🚪 Isolates resources to limit failure impact.
-> Think: one service failing shouldn't sink others.
------------------------------------------------------------
6. Saga Pattern 🔁 (Distributed Transactions)
-> Must-know for handling transactions across services.
💡 Types: Choreography (event-based), Orchestration (central coordinator).
🎯 Key for fintech, e-commerce systems.
------------------------------------------------------------
7. Event-Driven Architecture 📬
-> Loosely coupled systems via events.
💡 Tools: Kafka, RabbitMQ, SQS.
👀 Be ready to explain how services react to events asynchronously.
------------------------------------------------------------
8. CQRS Pattern ✍️🔍
⚖️ Separate reads and writes.
-> Great for scaling and complex domains.
💡 Often paired with Event Sourcing.
------------------------------------------------------------
9. Centralized Configuration Pattern 🛠
📦 Externalize configs to avoid redeploying.
-> Talk about Spring Cloud Config, Vault, K8s ConfigMaps.
------------------------------------------------------------
10. Distributed Tracing / Logging 🧵
🕵️‍♂️ Track requests across services.
💡 Tools: Zipkin, Jaeger, OpenTelemetry.
-> Be ready to explain correlation IDs and log aggregation.
