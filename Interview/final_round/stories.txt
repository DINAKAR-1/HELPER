1️⃣ CORE STORY — “Who I am & what I work on”

“I’m a backend/full-stack Java developer working primarily with Spring Boot. 
In my current role, I work on MIV, a government monitoring platform that provides dashboards and insights for financial transactions and applications.
My responsibility is mainly backend services, authentication, and ensuring reliability of user-facing features. 
I enjoy working on systems where correctness, stability, and clarity really matter.”

2️⃣ CHALLENGING PROBLEM — Ambiguity & assumptions (NON-PROD)

“One challenging problem I handled in MIV was dealing with unclear and evolving requirements for a user-facing feature.
Different stakeholders had slightly different expectations.
Instead of jumping into implementation, I clarified the core goal, validated assumptions with examples, and designed the solution in smaller parts 
so it could adapt to changes. 
This reduced rework and helped us deliver on time.”
or
“One technical challenge I worked on was designing role-based access control for different user types in MIV. The challenge was that access rules were evolving, and hard-coding checks would have made the system rigid and difficult to maintain.
I designed a centralized authorization approach where roles and permissions were clearly mapped, and access checks were handled consistently at the service layer. This made it easier to add new roles later without touching core business logic.”

3️⃣ PRODUCTION ISSUE — Redis cache issue (PROD)

 where users hittingh db for freq data and we introduced redis caching for that 
Covers:
Production issues, debugging, handling pressure, tight deadlines, failure under pressure

4️⃣ MISTAKE — Assumption / over-engineering

“Early on, I assumed a requirement was stable and implemented it based on initial understanding. Later, I realized expectations were slightly different. 
I took responsibility, clarified the requirement, and adjusted the solution. It taught me to validate assumptions early, especially for user-facing features.”

Covers:
Mistake, weakness, feedback, learning, self-awareness

5️⃣ PEOPLE STORY — Ownership & teamwork

“I’ve worked with teammates who were slower due to unfamiliarity with the system. Instead of escalating immediately,
I helped clarify tasks and shared context so delivery wasn’t blocked. When needed, I also kept the manager informed early.
I believe problems should be addressed constructively, not personally.”

Covers:
Slow teammate, mentoring, disagreement, ownership beyond role, manager feedback

6️⃣ MINDSET — How I work

“I stay motivated by seeing my work being used reliably by real users. For repetitive tasks, I focus on consistency and improving the process. I keep myself updated through documentation, practical implementation, and learning while working. To me, clean code means readable, maintainable code that’s easy to change. Technical debt should be managed consciously, not ignored.”

Covers:
Motivation, demotivation, boring work, learning, clean code, tech debt, code quality
