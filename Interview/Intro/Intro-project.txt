✅ Self-Introduction (60–90 seconds)

“Hi, I’m Dinakar, a Full Stack Java Developer with around 2.6+ years of experience, currently working at Center for Good Governance.

My core expertise is in Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, PostgreSQL, and React, with a strong focus on backend design, security, and scalable systems.

In my current role, I work on government-scale applications used by tens of thousands of users monthly. I’ve designed REST APIs, implemented JWT and RBAC security, optimized performance using Redis caching, and helped migrate systems from monolith to microservices.

I enjoy working on complex backend problems—things like authentication flows, async processing, database optimization, and system design—and I’m now looking to grow in a product-driven environment where engineering depth really matters.”

(Stop. Smile. Let them ask about projects. If they don’t—YOU pick one.)

🚀 Project 1: MIV Sand Booking Platform (Main Project)
High-level overview (what it is)

“One of my major projects is the MIV Sand Booking and Transportation Management Platform, which is a state-wide government system used by citizens to book sand online, make payments, track vehicles, and manage delivery operations across districts.

The platform currently serves 50,000+ active users per month and supports both web and mobile clients.”

Architecture (this is where you sound senior)

“The system is built using a microservices architecture with Spring Boot.

Each major domain—user management, booking, payments, grievances, notifications—is handled by an independent service. These services communicate via REST APIs, and the system is designed for independent deployments and scalability.”

If they nod → continue.
If they interrupt → good sign.

Security (VERY IMPORTANT)

“From a security standpoint, I implemented JWT-based authentication for both web and mobile APIs.

On top of that, we use Spring Security with fine-grained Role-Based Access Control, so actions like booking approval, payment verification, or grievance resolution are strictly role-restricted.

For high-value users, we also added Google Authenticator–based 2FA, which significantly improved account security.”

Drop that casually. Let it land.

Performance & Optimization

“Because this is a high-traffic system, performance was critical.

We introduced Redis caching for frequently accessed data like booking details and payment status, which reduced repetitive database calls by about 60% and noticeably improved response times during peak usage.”

Optional flex:

“We also paid attention to query optimization and avoided N+1 issues using proper fetch strategies.”

Notifications & Async Processing

“For user engagement and operational visibility, we integrated Firebase Cloud Messaging for real-time notifications—things like booking confirmation, payment updates, and delivery status.

These operations are handled asynchronously so that user actions remain fast and non-blocking.”

GenAI Chatbot (Bonus Power Move)

“Additionally, I worked on a GenAI-based chatbot using a RAG pipeline with Ollama LLM, built entirely in Spring Boot.

The chatbot answers user queries contextually using application data and FAQs, which reduced manual support queries by around 30%.”

This separates you from 90% of candidates. Period.

Your Role (OWN IT)

“I was involved end-to-end—from designing APIs and database schemas to implementing security, caching, and production issue fixes.

I also handled production debugging and performance issues, helping maintain 99.9% uptime.”

Stop here. Don’t overtalk. Seniors know when to shut up.
