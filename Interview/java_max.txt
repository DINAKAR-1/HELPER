abstract vs interfaces
before java 8

abstract class
should have abstrcat keyword on class
--> may contain abstarct function or may not but if class has abstract method its a abstarct class
--> have all access modifiers 
--> have normal varibles like class ,objects no rules like must be sstatic 
--> have default ,static methods 
-->have private construtor 

interfaces-->
--> only abstract methods 
--> only static final varibles
--> only public modifier 


after java 8 
--> interfaces
--> have default , static methods 
--> private meth but for internal use only 
--->still constants same 
-->No protected, package-private, or private for abstract methods
-->Only default/static methods can be private (from Java 9). from j9
