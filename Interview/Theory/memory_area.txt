-->method area 
all data about class 
static vars ,static final
method signature ,retunr types
constant pool which is referenced from the method area.(now its in heap)
------------------------------------------------------------
--> heaps
all objects 
All instance fields (whether object references or primitive types)
Even String literals go to a special area in the heap called the String Constant Pool, which is referenced from the method area.
Arrays, collections, Strings created via new or runtime concatenation
------------------------------------------------------------
-> stack
method call
method varibles --> not references ,only like int ,float 


Declaration	Stored how
static final int A = 10;	Inlined (constant pool / bytecode)
static final String S = "din";	String in pool (heap), ref in metadata
static final int B = getVal();	Method Area
static int x = 10;	Method Area
final int y = 10; (instance)	Heap (inside object)
final int z = 10; (local)	Stack
