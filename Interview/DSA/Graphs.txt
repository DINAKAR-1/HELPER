1. What is a Graph?
A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.

2. Types of Graphs
Graphs can be directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted, cyclic/acyclic, or connected/disconnected.

3. Representation
Graphs are usually represented using an adjacency list (efficient) or an adjacency matrix (simple).

4. Connected Components
A connected component is a maximal set of nodes where each node is reachable from every other node in that set.

5. BFS (Breadth-First Search)
BFS explores the graph level by level using a queue.

6. DFS (Depth-First Search)
DFS explores the graph deeply first using a stack (or recursion).

7. No. of Provinces Problem
Count connected components in an undirected graph of cities.

8. No. of Islands Problem
Count connected components in a grid (2D graph) where land is 1 and water is 0.
