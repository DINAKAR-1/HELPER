1. What is a Graph?
A graph is a collection of nodes (vertices) connected by edges.

2. Types of Graphs
Graphs can be directed/undirected, weighted/unweighted, cyclic/acyclic, or connected/disconnected.

3. Representation
Graphs are usually represented using an adjacency list (efficient) or an adjacency matrix (simple).

4. Connected Components
A connected component is a maximal set of nodes where each node is reachable from every other node in that set.

5. BFS (Breadth-First Search)
BFS explores the graph level by level using a queue.

6. DFS (Depth-First Search)
DFS explores the graph deeply first using a stack (or recursion).

 
bfs 
dfs

only when we its graph 
else we do bfs via grid way 

for bfs we take each and put its neighbors in queue 
and conusme each and for that each again neighbors


dfs goes whatever it finds first and if hits rock then bounce back and go to other in its way deeep
