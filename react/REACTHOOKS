use context 

to pass a common val or func among various childs

so in app.js 

create context and export 


export const context=React.context()

now in app.js we have suppose a usestate 


const [count,setCount]=useState(0);

now we can pass this same thing to all childs 

by just 

<context.provider>

<Child value={[count,setCount]}>



now we can access it in child by


const [count,setCount]= use context(contxt)
