in normal href in html we specify like for maven

including a css file in html present in templates

../static/css/styles.css

it means we come out of templates and search for css and dig inside 

but magic for thymeleaf is 

href ='@{/css/styles.css}

it resolves the path into context relative path 

so it becomes 

localhost:8800//project/static/css/styles.css
