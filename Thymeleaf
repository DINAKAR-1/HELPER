in normal href in html we specify like for maven

including a css file in html present in templates

../static/css/styles.css

it means we come out of templates and search for css and dig inside 

but magic for thymeleaf is 

href ='@{/css/styles.css}

it resolves the path into context relative path 

so it becomes 

localhost:8800//project/static/css/styles.css

and by defalut the maven has search for classpath:// resources/ ,classpth:/static 
so if we want to specify a folder as a static to the boot app

we need to config in properties file 

spring.web.resources.static-locations=classpath:/din/
here we are specifying to serch for static files in classpath/din/

it means after build it reolves into 

classpath == target/classes

and resources and java compiled classes are part of it so they all sit in a single place 

so now specified to search for target/classes/din/css or images ....or ...
