1.default method ..
2.static method ..
3.abstarct method in java interfaces 

default method is used for implementing code within method unlike abstract methods

and we can have static methods in interfaces also

default methods can be overriden in class implementing the interface but static cant be overriden

suppose customer is  a class 

so customer c1=new customer()

 to get class of c1 we do c1.getClass();

but if we dont have a instance of the class customer how to get class of it?

so there is a thing called '.class' it gives the class object of the the classs

customer c2

now calll customer.class it gives the class object of customer 

class object is used for info about class like methods and varibales
