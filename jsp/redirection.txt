redirect from a method to another method passing the paramters 
we can redirect to a method view and can also pass params without using url parameters 
traditional way 
return "redirect:/result?message=hello";

but we can see the paramters in the url so security issue 
so we send them as flash attributes to the method , but keep in mind to name the flashattrivute so that they dont collude in jsp and show it in jsp 

  redirectAttributes.addFlashAttribute("officerRaisedIssueId",officerRequestId);
            return new RedirectView("resolveIssue");

and in the method handler we can do 
----------------------------------------------
 @RequestMapping("/resolveIssue")
    public String resolveIssue(@RequestParam(name = "raisedIssueId", required = false) Long officerRaisedIssueId, Model model) {
        System.out.println("in this method");
       
        
         // Check if officerRaisedIssueId is null (not received as a request parameter)
    if (officerRaisedIssueId == null) {
        // Check if it's available as a flash attribute
          officerRaisedIssueId = (Long) model.asMap().get("officerRaisedIssueId"); 
          System.out.println(officerRaisedIssueId);
        
    }

we can grab the flashattribute by adding model to the method and 
get by model to map and get val by key
