JAVA_IO
-----------------

so to read and write we need 

reader and writer classes

but reader and writer are abstract classes

so we use the implemting subclasses
------------------

for reader(abstract)

          file reader 

          string reader 

          chararray reader
-----------------------
for writer(abstract)

          file writer

          string writer

          chararray writer

----------------------


but reader and writer is only reads 1 char at a time

but --buffered reader/writer -- gives 8kb buffer container 
 to store the input data 
and to make less calls to source to reterive data

so it fetches at a time and we can use it 

it gives readline() function to read one line at a time not like single char at a time


-------------------------
same like reader /writer as abstract class

 we have ---inputstream/outputstream --- as abstract classes

we can use thier implementing classes 

file inputstream

byteArray inputstream

buffered inputstream



same as reader but reader is for characeters and input stream is for bytes

----------------------------

fileinputstream is having read method which read only 1 at time 
but if we use read(byte[] a) with a certain sizze say 5;

so when it iterates through file having 22 charactrs 

so it stores in buffer array we provided with the size and it outputs it 

but when next 5 chars read it just overriting on top 
so when at last we have 2 chars like dd it replaces the hello 
with ddllo

its very significant 
same for readnbytes

------------------------


















-------------------

escape character -- \

\n: Newline

Represents a newline character. It is often used to create line breaks in strings.
\t: Tab

Represents a carriage return character. It can be used to move the cursor to the beginning of the line.
\\: Backslash

Represents a literal backslash. If you want to include a backslash in your string, you use \\.
\': Single Quote

Represents a literal single quote character. Useful when you need a single quote within a single-quoted string.
\": Double Quote

Represents a literal double quote character. Useful when you need a double quote within a double-quoted string.
\b: Backspace

means it doesnt delete really but outputs the thing if backaslashed

Represents a backspace character.
