to do pagination key concept is 

divide the array of posts or whatever...

so I'm having array of 10 things 

now we can do pagination either way 

front end way

we grab all posts 

and we slice them using js function slice 

array.slice(starting, ending)

now the buttons 1 2 3 4
now we can have a map iterator or forloop to 
make buttons by diving no of posts /posts per page 

so if no of pages 3 

return 3 buttons

now on evey button click pass the page value of the button to the current page variable 

and we get the first and last index by using current page and page size 

ex if page 3 so index is 3*postsper page ==30 

so last  index 30 and first index is 30 -no of posts per page ==20

key logic is 🗝️ 

slicing the array and display 


-------
now backend logic 


now we do the process in backend 

this way is more efficient as load is reduced

now we pass the pagenumber and pagesize to the backend and it gives us the part of array we need 

so we display that 

but it's not quite easy 
stay tuned ....
