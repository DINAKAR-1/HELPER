java -threading

arguments -- the actual values we pass to func

sum(3,4)

parameters -- the variables declared in the func 

sum(int a,int b)

CONCURRENCY AND PARALLELISM 

THREAIDNG GIVES CONCURRENT SUPPORT 

CONCURRENCY-- DOING ONE TASK AND HANDLING OTHER TASKS TOO

PARALLESLISM -- DOING MULTIPLE TASKS AT A TIME


WE CAN RUN A THREAD BY IMPLEMENTING RUNNABLE INTERFACE OR EXTENDING  THREAD CLASS 

1.class firstThread extends Thread 

AND use f1.start()


2.class firstThread implements Runnable

AND use a thread object and pass the object of our class to it and start

	    Thread1 bullet1=new Thread1();
            Thread2 bullet2=new Thread2();
            Thread gun1=new Thread(bullet1);
            Thread gun2=new Thread(bullet2);

            gun1.start();
            gun2.start();


LIFECYCLE OF A THREAD
---------------------


NEW 

RUNNABLE ---TRANSFER TO  ----->  NON RUNNABLE(BLOCKED)

RUNNING -----------------------------|^

TERMINATED

-----------

WE CAN PASS NAME TO A THREAD 

class Thread11 extends Thread {

  Thread11(String name) {
    super(name);
  }

  public void run() {
    System.out.println("hii");
  }
}


AND CAN RETRIVE BY USING .GETNAME() METHOD ON THE OBJECT

AND CAN ALSO GET THREAD ID BY .GETTHREADID


THREAD HAS MANY METHODS ---->

WE USE THREAD1.JOIN TO MAKE THE EXECUTION OF OTHER OTHER THREAD ONLY AFTER THIS GETS 
EXECUTED


AND THREAD.SLEEP(MILLISEC ..)
TO STOP THE THREAD EXECUTION FOR A CERTAIN AMOT OF TIME

--------------------
WE CAN ALSO GET THREAD STATE BY GETSTATE()
